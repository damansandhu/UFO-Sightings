# UFO-Sightings
## Project Overview
Using JavaScript to create filters to filter through UFO sightings based on:
* Date
* City
* State
* Country
* Shape
## Results
In this project users can input an item into the search criteria to receive an output if there is any matching data. The web page filters between 1-5 parameters and returns a result, providing that the requirement parameters are met. 
## Summary
Once there is a full deployment of the web application, there are no further updates of data on the back end. This can cause data to be obsolete  in the future. One workaround to this would be to scrape data to receive the most recent results or even live updates. Another would be to have the web page show you results as you type inputs into the entry points.
